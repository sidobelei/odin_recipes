        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h5>Cookies</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup softened butter</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons cream of tartar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Coating</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place parchment paper on a baking sheet and lightly grease. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F or 200 degrees C.</li>
            <li>Place in a large mixing bowl the white sugar, butter and eggs. Use an electric mixer to beat until smooth and creamy. In a separate bowl, mix in the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt. Pour this mixture into the mixer and stir until it forms a cohesive dough.</li>
            <li>Mix together in a separate bowl, the cinnamon and the rest of the white sugar.</li>
            <li>Form 2 teaspoons worth of dough into balls. Roll the newly form dough balls into your bowl of cinnamon sugar. Place each dough ball on your prepared baking sheet at least 2 inches apart.</li>
            <li>Place your baking sheet into the oven and bake for 7 minutes. Once baking is done let them cool before transferring them onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
