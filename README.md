# odin_recipes

The first project in The Odin Project was to build a simple website to display some of our favorite recipes.

This project focused mostly on HTML. Every webpage followed our "boilerplate" template that set up the declarations and elements for our content. Each recipe page employed the use of lists to organize all the recipe details. Images were embed from the websites that the recipes were attributed from. This website was minimally styled. The headers were what I had some freedom in adjusting. During the process of creating this website I utilized git for the first time to keep track of my work.
